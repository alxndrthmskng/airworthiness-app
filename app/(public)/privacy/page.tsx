            <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-foreground mt-8 mb-3">8. Social Features</h2>
            <p>Airworthiness offers optional social features that allow you to share your professional achievements with other engineers. These features are entirely opt-in and disabled by default. The core platform — licence tracking, digital logbook, training management — works fully without enabling any social feature.</p>
            <p><strong>What is shared when you enable a public profile:</strong> your name, optional profile photo, type ratings, licence categories, and any optional sections you choose to enable. Your profile becomes viewable at airworthiness.org.uk/profile/[your-id], where [your-id] is a randomly assigned 8-digit number that uniquely identifies your profile.</p>
            <p><strong>What is never shared, even with a public profile:</strong> your licence number, date of birth, employer, customer or operator names, logbook entries, exam scores, contact details, and your private licence photograph.</p>
            <p><strong>You are in control:</strong></p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
              <li>You choose whether to enable a public profile.</li>
              <li>You choose which optional sections to display.</li>
              <li>You can disable your public profile at any time, with immediate effect.</li>
              <li>You can delete your account at any time, which removes all data including any public profile.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Consent and withdrawal:</strong> Enabling a public profile is an explicit, separate consent action. You will be shown exactly what will be shared before you confirm. You can withdraw consent at any time from the Settings page. Withdrawal takes effect immediately on our live systems; backups will rotate out within 7 days.</p>
